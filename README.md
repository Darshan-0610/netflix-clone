# netflix-clone
A responsive Netflix homepage clone built using pure HTML and CSS, focused on clean structure, modern layout, and visual accuracy inspired by the original Netflix UI.  This project was created to practice frontend fundamentals, including semantic HTML, CSS layouts, and responsive design techniques—without using JavaScript or external frameworks.
